PWA Icons Required

Please create the following icon files and place them in the /public directory:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can:
- Use a tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Use PWA Asset Generator: https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator
- Create them manually in any image editor

The icons should represent your AR SOP Builder app.
For now, you can use simple placeholder images to get started.
